AyiAyiAyiYa
AyiAyi AyiYa (AyiAyi AyiYa)
AyiAyi AyiYa (AyiAyi AyiYa)
AyiAyi AyiYa (AyiAyi AyiYa)
AyiAyi AyiYa (STOP!)

You play me like a flipper
Up and down and left and right
Like a ball
I want you to be my stripper
And take off all your clothes
In the dark

Love is just a game
And to move in the shade with me
You can't avoid all the secrets you hold onto
Lock away
All those ties in your mind
Don't leave me in this dreamers kind of situation

Stop your self control
Just turn me off
Just burn me out
I'm gonna tickle you
So baby stop
Your self control
I'm gonna set you free tonight

Stop your self control
Just turn me off
Just burn me out
I'm gonna tickle you
So baby stop your self control
I'm gonna set you free tonight

You ride me like a cowgirl
Up and down and left and right
Like a bull
I want you to be my body
A pair of those big ears
And your head

Love is just a game
And to move in the shade with me
You can't avoid all the secrets you hold onto
Lock away
All those ties in your mind
Don't leave me in this dreamers kind of situation

Stop your self control
Just turn me off
Just burn me out
I'm gonna tickle you
So baby stop
Your self control
I'm gonna set you free tonight

Stop your self control
Just turn me off
Just burn me out
I'm gonna tickle you
So baby stop
Your self control
I'm gonna set you free tonight

AyiAyiAyiYa
AyiAyi AyiYa (AyiAyi AyiYa)
AyiAyi AyiYa (AyiAyi AyiYa)
AyiAyi AyiYa (AyiAyi AyiYa)
AyiAyi AyiYa (STOP!)

Stop your self control
Just turn me off
Just burn me out
I'm gonna tickle you
So baby stop
Your self control
I'm gonna set you free tonight

Stop your self control
Just turn me off
Just burn me out
I'm gonna tickle you
So baby stop
Your self control
I'm gonna set you free tonight

AyiAyiAyiYa
AyiAyiAyiYa
AyiAyiAyiYa
AyiAyiAyiYa
Stop! Your self control!
